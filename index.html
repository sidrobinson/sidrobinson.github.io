    <div class="aboutMe">About Me:</div>
    <div id="summary">I am big advocate on learning new efficient ways to work and apply it to my everyday lifestyle.
        I like sticking to what works, but I also tend to find time to develop more tactics and pathways. I have been
        exposed to the tech community for a number of years now. My mom and sister are both very immersed in tech. But,
        I never really dove in and tried to get a better understanding of what coding was.

        That is, until I recently began and completed a bootcamp at the Georgia Institute of Technology. There we were
        taught not only how to code and become a successful web developer; but were taught how to learn and study. I
        find that this prepared us a greater deal than other bootcamps. Learning how to learn. This was a big key in
        being comfortable in what we were learning and also with the unknown. This way, we were prepared for if/when
        companies had teams that did not use the full stack (M.E.R.N.) we were taught in the course.

        Outside of work, I live an active lifestyle. I tend to stick to mixed martial arts training but also like to
        rock climb. I stay adventurous with my activities and hobbies so I never end up stagnant in life or fitness.
        This keeps my mind open to change and ready for adaptation.

        I especially love to meet new people and be surrounded with different experiences. New experiences bring new
        challenges; with every new challenge, brings a new answer!

    <div id="summary">The first project was one of my favorite projects I have completed so far. This is a full stack
        app.
        The reasoning behind this app was to give power/control to those who want management but do not have a manager
        for their services. An artist or landscaper who does not have a manager or an individual with management
        experience would run into many people who would take advantage of this. For instance, if an artist is selling
        their work/services for $100. The myManager app has itâ€™s own process to separate those who are actually
        interested in those services for that base price, and those who would attempt to haggle the prices down. This
        ensures the best results for both parties involved. There are also a few other features my project partners and
        I thought on to take the view point of the contractor. Take a look at the <a
            href="https://mymanager19.herokuapp.com/">myManager App</a> and the <a

    <div id="summary">This second project was also fun! This was a full stack app. This project was built to help slack
        members save time. Some slack channels are used for classes, much like my own. So with that in mind, we noticed
        that a lot of teachers would have to set their own timers during breaks. Or bring up google to set timers. We
        wanted to simplify this situation. So with our app you can set a timer to save time and it be available to all
        members in the slack channel. One of the most challenging yet entertaining parts of this project was the game my
        team and I built inside the app. We thought it would bring a different look to the app as well as an ironic
        touch to it as well! Check out our <a href="https://breaksover.herokuapp.com/">breaksover-bot App</a> and the <a
